# robotic_arm_ml_description
This GitHub repository houses a ROS (Robot Operating System) package designed for controlling a robotic arm simulation in Rviz using hand movements captured from a camera. The package leverages computer vision techniques to interpret hand gestures, translating them into precise commands for the robotic arm.
